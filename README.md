# [CrackedLunarAccount](https://github.com/EmaBixD/CrackedLunarAccount)
A tool to generate accounts compatible with the official Lunar Client by producing an `accounts.json` file you can drop into your Lunar Client settings.

## How it works  
Credits: based on work by [Whatlify](https://github.com/Whatlify/CrackedLunarAccountTool?tab=readme-ov-file)

Lunar Client does not perform any online authentication or license check against Microsoft servers when loading local account data.  
Instead, it simply reads the `accounts.json` file from your user directory and loads every entry it finds.  
Each entry contains several fields such as `localId`, `remoteId`, and `accessToken`, but Lunar Client does not verify whether these correspond to a real Microsoft account.  
This means any properly formatted UUID value can be used as a placeholder.  
The web generator automatically creates a valid JSON structure with those placeholder values, allowing the client to treat them as legitimate local accounts during startup.

## Getting started
1. Download and install the official Lunar Client from the [official download page](https://www.lunarclient.com/download "Download Lunar").  
2. Open my web account generator: [https://emabixd.github.io/CrackedLunarAccount/](https://emabixd.github.io/CrackedLunarAccount "Account Generator")  
3. In the generator UI choose:
   - a **Username** (3‚Äì16 chars, letters/numbers/underscore), and  
   - either paste a **32-character UUID** (no dashes) or check **Auto-generate UUID** to create one.  
4. Click **Generate accounts.json** and review the output.  
5. Back up your existing Lunar Client `accounts.json` (if present).  
6. Replace the file at: `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.lunarclient\settings\game` with the generated file.
7. Restart Lunar Client.

## Notes
As of October 15, 2025 the web generator has restored functionality for creating local accounts.json entries. You may still see an in-game announcement every ~2 minutes:
